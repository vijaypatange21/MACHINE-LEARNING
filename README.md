# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects Collection

This repository is a curated collection of **machine learning projects** implemented using various real-world datasets (primarily from **Kaggle**). Each project demonstrates a specific ML use case, detailing the problem statement, approach, and model architecture.

The goal of this repo is to serve as a **learning hub** for both beginners and practitioners who want to explore different ML techniques, tools, and workflows.
